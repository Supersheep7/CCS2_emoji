Done:

1. Choose and collect 50-100 Emojis from tops 
2. Choose twitter dataset to work with
3. Filter dataset for those 50-100 emojis -> Get data
4. Single dataframe, started some analysis on how much emojis are there etc
5. Sanitize the data
6. Work on data, various
7. Commit to a first selection of emojis
8. Choose Model
9. Run FastText for extracting embeddings on data. Get T-SNE
10. Get embeddings of 97 emojis 

===

To do:

18/05

1. Collect distances from fasttext embeddings
2. Get encodings of 97 emojis from a (pre-trained?) autoencoder and collect distances

19/05

3. Design experiment: methods
4. Design experiment: sample bias analysis

20/05

5. Fuse the two representation in some relevant way

21/05

6. Collect distances for (N*N-1)/2 pairs of emojis
7. Select 50 relevant pairs of emojis to test against gold data

22-26/05 (switch to NLP and AIMAS videos)

8. Run experiment

27/05

9. Test pairs of emojis, distances of each model against gold

28-2/05

10. Plots, tables, results
11. Write report
